# What is a ChatBot
A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial
intelligence which conducts a conversation through auditory or textual methods. 

# Retrieval Based ChatBot
A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response. 
It is widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best 
experience.

The chatbot was trained on a dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses using a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify
which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

# Training the model
The model was trained on 3 layers using sing Keras sequential API where the first layer had 64 neutrons, second layer has 128 neutrons. The model was trained for 200 epoch and achieved an 
accuracy of 100%.
